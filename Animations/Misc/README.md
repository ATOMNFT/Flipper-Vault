# How to Install EASY!
  1. Plug in your flippers SD card.
  2. Download the animations folder of your liking (It contains .bm files along with a zip holding the manifest and all files. Delete zip before putting the folder on your device )
  3. Drag and drop the animation folder into the Flipper SD\Dolphin folder.
  4. Edit the manifest.txt in the dolphin folder of the SD and add this to the top.
```
name: <FOLDER_NAME>
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 14
Min level: 0
Max level: 30
Weight: 8
```

  - "name" is the name of the animations folder. (change according of course)
  - "Max level" adjust to max level if on custom firmware. (ie. 30, 15 etc)
  - "Weight" the higher the weight the higher the chance the animation will show up before other animations.
 
 5. Save file, eject SD, put SD in flipper, and reboot! All done!
